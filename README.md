My own attempt of a Full-UI Mod

## Yet Another UI Mod?

Yeah I know there are plenty of Full UI Mods out there. But none of 'em really catches my eye as they didn't seem to fit well to the fantasy setting of WoW. It is that fantasy setting I want to be preserved and fulfilled. And while the reworked default UI of Dragonflight is neat and beautiful I'd still like to customize it a bit more in my way.
